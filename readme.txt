== Description ==

The Smart Passworded Pages enhances WordPress by allowing the creation of central login pages that grant access to a any number of passworded child pages. In this fashion you can give each client/member/organization a central place to enter a password and they will be taken to the page that has their information.  
  
The password field is displayed as a field followed by a button with customizable text. The form is can be uniquely stylized with CSS. The child pages can in turn link to other pages protected with the same password and the password will not need to be re-entered.  
  
To add the password field to a page, simply enter the short code  
[smartpwpages]  
  
If you wish to assign a unique label to the submit button or give the form a unique ID for CSS identification, the attributes in the following example can be used:  
[smartpwpages label=\"Login\" ID=\"sppForm1\"]
